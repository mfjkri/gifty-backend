            "description": "How often have you set up your campsite, unrolled the awning, and discovered that the shade you had mid morning, is gone mid afternoon?

It will not work when Expedition Rails are installed in the same location as the Moveable Awning Arm.\n\n \n\nConsists of:\nMovable awning arm\nInstallation hardware\n\nMaterials used:\nBlack powder-coated steel\n\nProduct Dimensions:\n1234mm (48.6\") L x 356mm (14\") W x 120mm (4.7\") H\n\nWeight:\n11.26kg (24.8lbs)"

Awnings provide shade, comfort, and protection against the elements when camping. Speed and ease of setup is of paramount importance to enable usage while en-route, e.g. for a quick stop at lunchtime. Special importance has been given to the design of the structure to ensure strong mounting to guarantee that the awning stays stable when the wind blows. \n\nHannibals premium grade awnings are manufactured in Australia. The awning has no fold down leg posts and does not require pegs or ropes.\nThe awning can be set up by just 1 person and will take approx 30 seconds to complete.\nPolyurethane bushes allow the heavy duty aluminium fold out arms to swivel avoiding wear and tear. The awning arms are completely self supporting making for a quick set up. The awning cover is constructed of Polymide ripstop canvas while the roll out awning is made from the same canvas.\nSimply undo the the travel buckles, pull out the swing arms and walk the rolled canvas out to meet the swing arms. A steel locking mechanism locates at each end of the unrolled canvas, and once located to the arms the awning is ready for use.\nWaterproof, \"Dynaproofed\" 380g polycotton ripstop.\nSeams: Double stitched; edged with binding. All seams have been waterproofed.\nStitching: Superior strength quality thread (S25)\nOutrigger frame poles are aluminium\n\nPrice included installation\nFor more information, kindly contact us.
