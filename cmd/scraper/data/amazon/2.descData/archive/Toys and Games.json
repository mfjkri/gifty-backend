        "description": "„ÄêUpgraded Backyard/Beach Paddles Ball„ÄëWe use 101% new, unbreakable materials with high toughness. Criss-crossed stitches make the sticky ball cloth tightly adhere to the plastic disc, making the new version more durable and stronger than the old version. This ball game is water resistant and can be played indoors or outdoors, at the beach or pool, in the backyard, park, or garden.\n„ÄêSofter and High-quality Ball Set„ÄëThe old version's tennis balls were very hard and lacked elasticity, making them difficult for kids to catch. Our balls are much stronger and softer, yet still have great stickiness, so kids can easily catch them and enjoy a comfortable feel. Kids won't lose their fun because they can keep catching the ball. This ball game is always lots of fun for little ones, even at family reunions.\n„ÄêLengthened and Adjustable Strap„ÄëThe strap has an adjustable design, making it convenient to adjust while playing. The length of the strap is also long enough for adults, so both adults and children can participate in the toss and catch game. There are no set rules, making it a great outdoor activity for the whole family to enjoy.\n„ÄêKeep the Kids Active, Learning Basic Motor Skills„ÄëThe catch and toss game helps kids develop hand-eye coordination and arm muscles, keeping them active and helping to release their extra energy. It is an effective way for kids to learn about baseball and football. EVERICH paddle rackets have been laboratory tested and are safe and non-toxic, so they are safe for kids to play with.\n„ÄêOutdoor/Sand/Backyard Game, Great Gift„ÄëThe EVERICH catch ball set comes with a transparent zip-up bag for easy carrying and storage. It is a fun game and high-quality sand toy. It is great for boys and girls ages 3-12 as a birthday or Christmas gift, helping them to stay away from screens and form good exercise habits."
